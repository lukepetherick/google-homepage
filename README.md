Built a simple google homepage from the 2010 era.

Uses basic HTML and CSS, does not search, merely the landing page with no function.

Was helpful in order to learn better with CSS. The page I based it off had a lot of the spacing and CSS in the HTML code, as well as many HTML commands which were obsolete, which made my code a little bit messy in the end. 

Good learning curve.
